<h3>Instructions:</h3>

      <li>The "Data Input Person" randomly select any of the boxes by tapping or clicking on them.</li>
      <li>The "Parity Checker" will make things more complicated by clicking on the "Increase Difficulty" checkbox.</li>
      <li>The "Data Input Person" changes one of the boxes without the "Parity Checker" looking.</li>
